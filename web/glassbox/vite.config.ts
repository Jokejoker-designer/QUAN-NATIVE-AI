 * plugin, the Better Auth OAuth popup middleware, the Grok PWA plugin, and the
 * Vercel Nitro preset. This is a local instrument for one FPGA on one desk. It
 * has no accounts, no database and no deploy target, and each of those brought
 * its own failure modes plus about eleven megabytes of WebAssembly.
 *
 * Binds to 127.0.0.1 rather than 0.0.0.0: the studio will eventually hold an
 * open serial link to the board, and that must not be reachable from the LAN.
